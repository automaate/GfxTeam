Legato Composer Testing

A number of 'must have' test cases has been added to the spreadsheet for each function requirement. All requirements will be tested against 8 quality categories. In each category there are specific characteristics that can be measured. Use these measurements to help determine and test the quality of Legato Composer.

When testing, you should ask the specific questions below.

4.1	Functional Suitability Tests
This characteristic represents the degree to which Legato composer provides functions that meet stated and implied needs when used under specified conditions. This characteristic is composed of the following sub-characteristics.

*	Functional completeness -  Degree to which the set of functions covers all the specified tasks and user objectives. **Is the requirement met?**
*	Functional correctness -  Degree to which Legato composer provides the correct results with the needed degree of precision. **Does the function return correct results?**
*	Functional appropriateness - Degree to which the functions facilitate the accomplishment of specified tasks and objectives. **Is the way it implemented appropriate?**

4.2	Performance Efficiency Tests
This characteristic represents the performance relative to the amount of resources used under stated conditions. This characteristic is composed of the following sub-characteristics:

*	Time behaviour - Degree to which the response and processing times and throughput rates of a product or system, when performing its functions, meet requirements.  **Does the function with efficent timeliness**?
*	Resource utilization -  Degree to which the amounts and types of resources used by a product or system, when performing its functions, meet requirements. **Does the function make efficient use of timeliness?**
*	Capacity -Degree to which the maximum limits of composer meet requirements.  **Does the function use efficent capacity?**.

4.3	Compatibility Tests
Degree to which Legato composer can exchange information with other products (MPLABX), systems or components, and/or perform its required functions while sharing the same hardware or software environment. This characteristic is composed of the following sub-characteristics:

*	Co-existence - Degree to which a product can perform its required functions efficiently while sharing a common environment and resources with other products, without detrimental impact on any other product. **Does function co-exist?**.
*	Interoperability - Degree to which two or more systems, products or components can exchange information and use the information that has been exchanged. **Does the function interoperable?**.

4.4	Usability Tests
Degree to which Legato composer can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction in a specified context of use. This characteristic is composed of the following sub-characteristics:

*	Appropriateness recognizability - Degree to which users can recognize whether a product or system is appropriate for their needs. **Does the function meets the user needs?**
*	Learnability - Degree to which Legato composer can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals of learning to use the product or system with effectiveness, efficiency, freedom from risk and satisfaction in a specified context of use. **Is the function easy to learn?**
*	Operability - Degree to which Legato composer has attributes that make it easy to operate and control. **Is the function easy to operate?**
*	User error protection.  Degree to which Legato composer protects users against making errors. **Is the function protected from errors**?
*	User interface aesthetics - Degree to which a user interface enables pleasing and satisfying interaction for the user. **Is the function appealing aesthetically?**
*	Accessibility - Degree to which Legato composer can be used by people with the widest range of characteristics and capabilities to achieve a specified goal in a specified context of use.  **Is the function accessible to a wide range of users (do you have to be an expert)?**

4.5	Reliability Tests
Degree to which Legato composer performs specified functions under specified conditions for a specified period of time. This characteristic is composed of the following sub-characteristics:

*	Maturity - Degree to which Legato composer meets needs for reliability under normal operation. **Is the function mature?**
v	Availability -  Degree to which Legato is operational and accessible when required for use. **Is the function available when you need it?**
*	Fault tolerance - Degree to which Legato composer operates as intended despite the presence of hardware or software faults. **Is the function fault tolerent**?
v	Recoverability - Degree to which, in the event of an interruption or a failure, Legato composer can recover the data directly affected and re-establish the desired state of the system. **Is the function  recoverable on error or other adverse event**?

4.6	Security Tests
Degree to which Legato protects information and data so that persons or other products or systems have the degree of data access appropriate to their types and levels of authorization. This characteristic is composed of the following sub-characteristics:

*	Confidentiality - Degree to which Legato composer ensures that data are accessible only to those authorized to have access. **Is the function confidential within the task?**.
